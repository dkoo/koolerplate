# Koolerplate

A super simple, ES6-enabled front-end boilerplate project for super quick prototyping. Just the bare minimum of stuff to start writing some code:

* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) with [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
* [JSHint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint) to check syntax (could use more testing components)
* [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) for ES6 syntax
* [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) for JS bundling
* [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) to tie it all together

And that’s it!

# Usage

Clone it and run `npm install` at the command line and you’re good to go. You’ll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to start.
