# Koolerplate

A super simple front-end framework for super quick prototyping. Just the bare minimum of stuff to start writing some code:

* SASS because why not
* Autoprefixer: forget about writing styles with prefixes
* JSHint to check syntax (could use more testing components)
* Browserify to manage JS modules/dependencies
* Uglify to make it unpurty
* Gulp-based workflow for speed

And that’s it!

# Usage

I don’t expect anyone else will want to use such a barebones framework, but if you really want to, just clone it and ```npm install``` it and you’re good to go. You’ll need the usual suspects ([node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)), and something like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) for serving it locally.

I may add more stuff over time, but I’m off writing some code.
